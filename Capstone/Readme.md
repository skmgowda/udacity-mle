#Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project

##Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project involves building a LSTM (long-short term memory) networks model to predict stock price.
Historical daily trading data of all the companies in S&P 500 are downloaded using yfinance and saved as trrading_daily_s&p500.csv in data.zip
The model is built using Keras with Tensorflow backend.
All the code and result can be found in the code_capstone_final.ipynb . Running the notebook should reproduce the results.
Various results files are stored as well.
The project proposal is the proposal.pdf and the final report is the report.pdf.
